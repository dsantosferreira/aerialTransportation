# Aerial Transportation
This repository holds our second project for the Algorithms and Data Structures course unit

## Objectives
Develop algorithms that show the main information about a graph, in this case, an airway network graph. The program should be able to give the best way to travel between two places. A place can be:
- A specific airport;
- A specific city (you should consider any airport in the city;
- A circular area (that is every point that is in a circle with center in the coordinates chosen and radius also chosen by the user)
In addition to that, the user can limit the airway companies that are used.
The program should also be able to give some basic information about the overall graph such as how many airports there are, how many airway companies there are, how many flights are needed to reach a certain airport, etc.
